* Properly support search terms like <table>  (currently breaks search and views)
* Better handle long lines
* A line to summarize results, e.g. 18 lines matched in 5 files
* Remember match case and with context values
* Get grep to flush output for live search result display
* Bring ack search up to date with grep features
* Figure out why ack searching is failing (ack won't return results)
* Per-project settings
